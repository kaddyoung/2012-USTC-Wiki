					<p>This summer, USTC-Software team is going to combine experiment data, genetic circuits and mathematical models into a single software, one that not only enables us to better understand Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRNs), but also provide researchers with complete workflows. 
                    <P/><br/>
			        
					<p/>Genetic Regulatory Network (GRN) has been a major subject in recent researches of synthetic biology, and the modulation of a GRN gives rise to a variety of exciting works among iGEM programs as well as softwares assisting synthetic biology researches. Traditionally, researches of GRNs have been focused on either connecting GRNs with real parts on a plasmid or with experimental data, but complete work that combines the three factors have not been paid enough attention to. Here we propose a project that aims to fully connect them with a software that enables us to study GRNs in a much more efficient way. </p> <br/>
			
					<p/>The project starts from using experimental data to generate proper ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the behavior of the given data. With ODEs, we can abstract the possible GRNs and use the Parts available in registry to generate plasmid models that can be used in experiments. In this way, we combine mathematics, biology and experiments, the three main areas supporting a complete iGEM project, in a single software. <br/>
